I will make a promise to you that we will spend more quality time together, night-time without social media disruption, grow smarter emotionally and intelligently, wear cool-ass outfits and go on a date-night every month. That's the least I can do.\n\nI only wish that this year, you will have more audacity to speak what you think, do what you want, get what you hope for and take action to achieve your goals. Most importantly, think about what you want in life or this year, you're young so cherish every piece of time you have and make the most of it. I'm a guy so I'm so logical about these stuffs, I plan and calculate a lot, maybe a bit of that (logical, planning, calculating) will do good for your life. So, answer this: What do you want for yourself this year?\n\nThank you for bring smiles to my face all the time.",

Life is still long but make sure you use it wisely, make plans to travel around more (at least 1 near and 1 far place a year) as this is what I wish I have done in your age. I thought when I have money, I will travel more but I can hardly find the time.\n\nTraveling is one of the cheap actions that you can do to get out of your comfort zones - the house and the city you know too well. So do that more, I think that will eventually form a habit of getting out of your comfort zones somehow.\n\nBe hungry, brother.",
